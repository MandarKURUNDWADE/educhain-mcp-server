Future learning paths include: Advanced Python, Data Structures and Algorithms, Web Frameworks (Django, Flask), Machine Learning libraries (Scikit-learn, TensorFlow).",
  "ethical_considerations": "As students learn to code, it's important to discuss ethical considerations such as responsible data usage, avoiding bias in algorithms, and the potential impact of AI on society. For example, discussing the ethical implications of facial recognition technology or the use of algorithms in loan applications can be valuable."
